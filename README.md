Maze Generator and Solver

This project contains a Maze Generator and Solver, where the mazes are represented as n x m matrices, and the path is represented by a series of directions (South, East, North, and West).
Features

    Generate an n x m maze based on user input.
    Output a path in the maze using a series of directions (South, East, North, West).
    Draw the maze and path visualization, and reveal the path with a button press.

Getting Started

To use the Maze Generator and Solver, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies (if necessary).
    Run the main script and follow the on-screen instructions.

Usage
Generate a Maze

To generate a maze, run the Maze.java file and provide the desired dimensions (n x m) as input. The generated maze will be stored as a matrix, with each cell containing information about the walls present or absent.

Solve the Maze

To solve the maze, run the solve_maze.py script. The script will output a path in the form of directions (S, E, N, W), representing South, East, North, and West respectively.

Visualize the Maze and Path

To visualize the maze and path, use the button in the Java file. This will draw the maze and reveal the path upon pressing a button.
