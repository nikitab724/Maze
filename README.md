Maze Generator and Solver

This project contains a Maze Generator and Solver, where the mazes are represented as n x m matrices, and the path is represented by a series of directions (South, East, North, and West).
Features

    Generate an n x m maze based on user input.
    Output a path in the maze using a series of directions (South, East, North, West).
    Draw the maze and path visualization, and reveal the path with a button press.

**Getting Started**

To use the Maze Generator and Solver, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies (if necessary).
    Run the main script and follow the on-screen instructions.

**Usage**
**Generate a Maze**

To generate a maze, run the Maze.java file and provide the desired dimensions (n x m) as input through the use of the sliders. The generated maze will be stored as a matrix, with each cell containing information about the walls present or absent.

**Solve the Maze**

To solve the maze, click the 'Show Path' button. The script will output a path in the form of directions (S, E, N, W), representing South, East, North, and West respectively and will visually show you the path.

**Visualize the Maze and Path**

To visualize the maze and path, use the button in the Java file. This will draw the maze and reveal the path upon pressing a button.
